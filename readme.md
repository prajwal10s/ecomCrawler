## Decisions

1. Choosing the stack:

   - We will be using Python cause it has a lot of libraries for web crawling
   - We will use Scrapy framework as it is specifically designed for web crawling. It also handles duplicated by default

2. How to Identify URLs:
   - We will be using Regex to match the URLs we find to find the product URLs from there
